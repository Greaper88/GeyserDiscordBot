Since this is a service for *joining* servers and not hosting them, we are going to go with a DADT (don't ask, don't tell) policy. We don't know if you own a legit Java account or not, and so long as you don't tell us, we won't ask. Support will be limited to how to setup the connection info in GC, any other purposes will be met with "we don't support cracked servers."

Any discussions about finding ways to circumvent needing a paid account other than `"Find a offline or floodgate-enabled server"` can be constituted as piracy, and shall not be discussed here.
