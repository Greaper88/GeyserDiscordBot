Whenever you login to your Microsoft Account (MSA), you may get an email from Microsoft about "suspicious activity." This is normal, and to be expected. This server is a proxy, and acts like any other proxy or internet VPN by hiding your real IP from Microsoft. This means when you login, the security email will show you an IP address from Austin, TX, USA, which is where the server is hosted.
