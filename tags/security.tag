Whenever you login to your Microsoft Account (MSA), you may get an email from Microsoft about "suspicious activity." This is normal, and to be expected. This server is a proxy, and acts like any other proxy or internet VPN; and hides your real IP from Microsoft, so when you login, the security email will show you an IP address from Austin, TX, USA.
