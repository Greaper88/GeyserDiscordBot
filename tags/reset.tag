There is a bug we have been unable to figure out, where from time to time entering the "Custom Servers" list will cause players' games to crash. We can fix this for you by resetting your profile. We are collecting whatever information we can about why this is happening.
Please run `+apply reset` in <#795436293999165450> to get the process started. We will respond once we have cleared your profile.
